Dev-Hub is an online blog platform with a focus on project specific blogs for new developers to learn and organise their thoughts.

I began this project with the intention of creating a single blog to track the progress of Profile Creator. This project later expanded and is now in the works to become an online blogging platform. Users will be able to sign in using Google, and from there they will be able to checkout other users projects/blogs as well as create their own.
